      <p>Now, when not working with his consulting clients, William spends as much time with his family as possible. He loves working with his hands, so much so I had to convince him his time was literally not worth working on the lawn, despite how much he enjoys it. He finds projects wherever he can, and is incredibly handy. When his daughter and son-in-law decide that they need to remodel a bathroom, you can count on William to be helping cut tile. He plays an insane amount of tennis, and maintains a very active schedule. He enjoys being a Grandfather quite a bit, and spends a lot of time with his grandchildren. He is not necessarily seeking out to grow his business, but has found himself quite busy since his retirement from the Navy. He enjoys his Mini Cooper, his two dogs Annie and Teddy, and just seeks to maintain keeping busy.</p>
