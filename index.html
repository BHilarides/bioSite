      <p>The subject of my BioSite is William Hilarides, my mentor, personal hero, and above all - my Father. At this point in life and his career, William's goals are to ensure that he stays busy while maintaining a healthy work-life balance. His success started at a young age, voted "Most Likely to Succeed" coming out of Amos Alonzo Stagg High School, leading him into a Naval College athletic career where he swam the butterfly stroke, while serving as master of the Naval Academy Sailing Squadron. He took on a life of submarines after college, where he worked his way up through the ranks to take command of the USS Key West from 1998 to 2000. Only continuing his career's upward trajectory, his final role in the Navy was the 43rd commander of the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA). While spending his time building his career, he also spent many hours learning and working on his own homes. Through the power of determination and intelligence, William taught himself how to work on any aspect of his home by reading books, whether it is soldering pipe for a bathroom, hanging drywall, or laying tile. His career took an exponential path, but was not without moments of difficulty. In 1993, while aboard the USS Maryland, the ship ran aground (not his fault). He was in the Pentagon on 9/11, and while serving as commander of NAVSEA had a tragic shooting occur in his building. Despite the difficulties, he has continued becoming more determined, intelligent, and is the best man I know.</p>
